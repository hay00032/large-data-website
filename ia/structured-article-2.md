Remember when your parents used to say that tea would stunt your growth? That couldn't be farther from the truth. Medicinal properties in tea are beneficial to your health and well-being. Tea contains vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. A cup of tea has less than half the caffeine of coffee and is gentler on the body. While tea may not give you the fast kick that you get with a cup of coffee, it will certainly boost your energy levels and your immune system. 

Tea is anything that comes from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) -- varieties include green tea, black tea, white tea and oolong tea. "As long as the tea leaf is present, then you're going to have the benefits," says Shabnam Weber, owner of The Tea Emporium in Toronto. Throw in your favourite herbal or spice blend, such as orange blossom or chai, and you're in for a treat. Consider also the added health benefits of herbal blends, such as peppermint for reducing hot flashes, ginger for aiding digestion, or Rooibos, which is caffeine-free and very high in antioxidants.

If you're not convinced that a soothing cup of hot tea may be just what the doctor orders for a clean bill of heath, Shabnam serves up 8 reasons to indulge in teatime.
