varieties: Elderflower

description: The white blossom from the Elder tree is a traditional cure for colds. It is an effective decongestant because it helps clean the nasal passages of catarrh. It is also a good diaphoretic - meaning it encourages the body to sweat. Naturopaths believe that viruses are unable to breed in a raised body temperature.

Herbal teas are all the rage for the many medicinal qualities they are supposed to possess. It's claimed they can help with everything from easing a cold and indigestion to fighting infection and nausea.
But when choosing a herbal tea remedy, make sure you pick the right one. While fruit flavoured teas - such as rosehip, apple and orange - tend to be delicious, they are developed for their flavouring more than anything else.
Herbal teas on the other hand, such as thyme, peppermint and ginger have greater therapeutic virtues.
Susan Curtis, a homeopath for Neals Yard Remedies, says that fruit teas tend to be blended from synthetic ingredients, but herbal teas often contain real herbs. 'This means they make effective remedies if drunk at least three to four times a day,' she says.
Susan suggests reading the ingredients first. 'If the label mentions real herbs then the quality will be good,' she says. 'Avoid any teas with artificial flavourings. The best quality herbal teas tend to be organic.'
We've rounded up ten herbal teas picked for their medicinal benefits and explain what each could do for you.
