# Herbal Teas
There are numerous variations, recipes, and uses for herbal teas. It is a refined practice that has united generations of families, friends and acquaintances of all cultures. It is a practice that is mythological, medicinal, and recreational. A lot of beauty can be found in its ingredients, packaging, and process, which makes this culture so inspiring.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a large-scale functional website. It will expand my coding knowledge and the use of design-systems.

This website will showcase layout design, interactive design, as well as illustration and two-dimensional artwork. As a result I will have a complete and finished multi-page website that will be used as a portfolio piece.
