#Style Report

##Visual Style 1 - India
The theme of this style was to examine the indan tea culture. Rustic themes, gold, and deep hues would accentuate this feeling. 

###Pros
- Straight to the point
- Follows the culture of Herbal Tea
- Visually colourful and appealing
- Traditional

###Cons
- Too traditional
- Theme is mature and therefore may have the idea of being directed towards an older audience
- Could easily be content heavy

##Visual Style 2 - Illustrated
Attempting a modern and contemporary twist on the topic, this visual style concentrates on illustrated elements, seen in the lettering as well as images. 

###Pros
- Soft colours make it easy on the eyes
- Lost of white space make it contemporary
- Illustrations will add a playfulness to the theme and make it visually appealing

###Cons
- May appear to be child friendly with the illustrations
- Hand written fonts may make it difficult for an older audience to read 

##Visual Style 3 - Flat
This style was influenced by the current and popular theme of geometric and flat design. Keeping with bold accent colours and sharp edges this theme is more rigid and contemporary.

###Pros
- Flows with current web design trends
- Colourful
- Contemporary

###Cons
- May not appeal to a large audience. 
- Style of design may only appeal to a specific design crowd or multimedia user audience
- Might be difficult to differentiate between a design based website or a herbal tea based website 


#Result
I think Visual Style 2 would be the best solution for this website. It fits between being too classical and being too contemporary. Line illustration art is currently trendy in the modern tea culture therefore would assist in targeting a younger audience as well as an older for its simplicity. For a site that focuses on Herbal Teas, this style has not been looked at, therefore would be an interesting twist on Tea Culture in the media.
